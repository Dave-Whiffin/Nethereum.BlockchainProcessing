# Nethereum.BlockchainProcessing

## Summary

Most of the processing code has moved into the Nethereum core repo (Aug 2019), so it will be accessible from the Nethereum.Web3 nuget.

The storage adapters have moved to the Nethereum.BlockchainStorage repo (July 2019) (where possible we have retained the history).

What remains here are samples for blockchain processing and some experimental projects.
