# Nethereum.BlockchainProcessing

## Summary

WARNING - WORK IN PROGRESS!

We are currently refactoring and moving blockchain processing code between repositories.  

Most of the processing code is moving into the Nethereum core, so it will be accessible from the Nethereum.Web3 nuget.
https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.BlockchainProcessing/

The storage adapters have moved to the Nethereum.BlockchainStorage repo (where possible we have retained the history).
https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.BlockchainStorage/

This repository will continue to be used for processing samples and more specialized processing components.
